          <p class=post>One of our new favorite places to eat has been a local
            vegan restaurant with modern Polish food. It's also a great place to
            take family and friends who visit because they cater to a variety of
            dietary restrictions/needs, but still serve great food that everyone
            can enjoy.</p>
