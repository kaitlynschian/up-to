          <h3 class='postTitle'>Pepper Pizza</h3>
          <h6 class='date'>August 27, 2018</h6>
          <img class='postImg' src='images/pepper-pizza.jpg' alt='a slice of pepper pizza'>
          <p class='post'>This summer, we’ve been enjoying fresh local vegetables
            from a CSA. It’s been really nice to have lots of produce coming in
            every week but it’s also an interesting challenge to come up with
            recipes to use up a selection of things we might not normally buy.
            This week we had a pile of sweet peppers and some leftover bread
            dough in the fridge so we decided to make a big pepper pizza. We
            based it on <a class='recipeLink' href='https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017930-pizza-with-sweet-and-hot-peppers?smid=pin-share' target="_blank">
            this</a> recipe from the NY Times with quite a few changes to
            incorporate ingredients we already had in the fridge as well as
            scale back the quantity for two people. </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Used the rest of a jar of pickled jalapeños instead of fresh</li>
            	<li>Added pickled banana peppers</li>
            	<li>Used white onion instead of red</li>
            	<li>Used crumbled bacon instead of sausage</li>
            	<li>Omitted marjoram</li>
            	<li>Used marinated fresh mozzarella with red pepper instead of plain</li>
            </ul>
          <p class='post'>This was a great easy meal to prepare (especially if you already
            have the dough on hand) and  turned out to be really versatile and
            delicious allowing for us to make all of the changes we did.</p>
