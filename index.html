            <h1>Exploring Pittsburgh & Hanging Out</h1>

            <p>Since we moved we get a lot of questions about what we're up to,
            where we've been, and what interesting things we've done lately. </p>

            <p>Although my gut response is that we're just not very interesting
            people, the truth is that it is really fun and exciting to explore
            a new city.</p>

            <p>This site is dedicated to those new and interesting experiences,
            and also any other projects we happen to be working on.
            Thanks for visiting and check back soon for updates!</p>
